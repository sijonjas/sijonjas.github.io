								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project is to create a model that follows the criteria of creating a prototype exoskeleton that demonstrates a simple mechanical joint. In order to fulfil this criteria the group had decided to create a gorilla model that would be 3D printed, this choice was largely inspired by the King Kong animatronic from 1976. In order to achieve this goal a group was formed to increase the amount of budget that was available, for a single person there was a £50 allotment but, through the group the total budget increased to £150 which would allow for more creative freedoms. However, to get the model completed a project plan was required which was as follows:</p>
								<p> 
									Create a specification for the model<br>
									Develop and flesh out a concept<br>
									Design the model<br>
									Prepare the materials required
								</p>
								<p>The specification for the gorilla model is that it must be durable as its design is akin to an action figure so it must be able to withstand impacts along with this since it is going to be designed as an action figure it is important that none of the materials that are used in the creation of the model are not toxic. Moreover, in order to fulfil the requirement that the prototype needs to have a simple mechanical joint the gorilla was originally have the head and both of the arms connected to the body via ball joints although this was later changed to just having the arms having the ball joint connection in order to make the design simpler. </p>
								<p>For the process of developing a concept it was important to determine the scale of the project, first was determining the size of the gorilla which initially was going to about 30 centimetres tall although this was later changed to be approximately 15 centimetres after discussion of budgetary implications. Next was the appearance of the gorilla which was going to have a realistic style along with it being positioned on all fours, the skin would be grey, the teeth would be white and there would be fur protruding from the body excluding the face, chest, hands, and feet which would also be black.</p>

								<h3>3D scanning</h3>
								<p>3D scanning is a technique used to capture a 3 dimensional image of a physical object as stated by Haleem, Javaid, Singh, Rab, Suman, Kumar and Khan (2022) although 3D scanning goes beyond what is stated in this definition as it is able to capture a physical object size and dimensions. The way that 3D scanning works is by using lasers as the scanner is able to emit lasers, the light from the lasers reflect off the surface of the object that is being scanned back into the scanner, then measures the time that is taken for the light to be reflected back and determines the distance. After this a software that is connected to the scanner such as Skanect is able to generate a 3D model based on this data. The use of 3D scanning is currently being used in the automotive industry by companies such as Ford, 3D SCANNING TECHNOLOGY HELPS TRANSFORM MICHIGAN CENTRAL STATION (2020) states that 3D scanning has been used to generate models of old car pieces that no longer exist or have documentation. The benefits of using 3D scanning for creating a prototype include high accuracy as a result of the point clouds which are collected by the scanner from the reflected laser lights and digitally represent an objects surface and details. However, there are limitations to using 3D scanning for instance, the surface reflectivity of an object can impact the results, as highly reflective surfaces are able to overwhelm the scanner with their strong reflections in contrast, surfaces that low or non-reflective have a weak reflected light which may not be picked up by the scanner. The reason why 3D scanning is suitable for prototype development is that it can generate models without the need to create one manually and will be able to capture the details of the physical model. 3D scanning was used in this in this project to generate a model of a gorilla from a physical version, the reason for this is that it would provide a detailed model for the prototype moreover, it saves a considerable amount of time in comparison to creating one due to a lack experience in creating models. Using the 3D scanner did take some time and money as first the model that would be scanned cost approximately £12, then in order to make the model look as good as possible the model was scanned thoroughly. </p>

								<h3>PLA</h3> 
								<p>Polylactic acid (PLA) is made from resources that are renewable and organic such as corn starch and is a compostable material. PLA sees use for plastic bottles, food packaging and disposable cutlery though for this project PLA is able to be used as the material for 3D printing the model. One of the benefits of using PLA include the fact that is does not release any toxic fumes and it is also biodegradable. A limitation of using PLA is that it absorbs moisture from the air which can result it in becoming brittle. The reason why PLA was chosen for this project is that it is a material that is easy to print using the 3D printer and that it is the cheapest material to use as it approximately £12-£30 per kilogram.</p>
								<h3>Silicone rubber</h3> 
								<p>Silicone rubber as stated by Ueki, Oshida, Sando, and Seko (2022)  is rubber material that possess superior weatherability, heat resistance, and has chemical resistance in comparison to natural and synthetic rubbers. Silicone rubber has many uses in the aerospace industry as it can be used for making space suit fabrics, windshields and abrasion resistant coatings as stated by Varied uses of silicone rubber (no date). One of the benefits of using silicone rubber is that it is a durable material with it being resistant to wear and tear. A limitation of using silicone rubber is that it is depending on the silicone rubber formula it may become brittle when exposed to sunlight. The reason for using silicone rubber for this project is that it would give the gorilla model a more flesh-like texture and would provide protection for the model, this would be done by placing a silicon skin over the body of 3D printed the gorilla model cover all of the body except from the hands, feet, and head.</p>
								<h3>Fur, paint and dye</h3> 
								<p>The use of fur for the gorilla model is to make it more realistic with it being placed on the head, arms, legs and back of the model. The way the fur will be attached is by puncturing small holes into the silicone rubber outer skin and inserting the fur into these holes and gluing it in place. The purpose of the dye is to be able to colour the fur and the paint is for the 3D printed model to get the correct colours for the gorilla’s body and using the dry brushing technique will allow for more detail to be added.</p>
								<h3>Composite material</h3> 
								<p>A composite material is often made up of 2 or more materials that are of different physical and chemical properties, with it often being used to build a variety of different things ranging from bathtubs to racing car bodies. Composite material offers benefits such as flexibility as it can be moulded into complex shapes and that composite materials have the potential to be more environmentally friendly due to it being able to use recycled materials such as plastic. However, there are limitations to using composite materials, one example of this as stated in What are some challenges and opportunities of using composite materials for engineering design? (2023), is that composite materials are complex and often require the use of specialised equipment and techniques for processing which results in composite materials being expensive. The reason why this material is not suitable for this project is due to the fact that it is the most expensive option for a material with it being approximately £45-£100 per kilogram, as there is a limited budget it would put constraints on other aspects of the project.</p>
